PhotoGallery is a platform from where users can download high quality and original images. 
It breaks the gap between the user and the photographer. 
Though many images are available on internet but using them can create copyright issues. 
Also, various freelancer photographers face the problem where their images are being misused or used without permission as they are easily available on the internet. 
With this project, we can overcome this issue. 
In order to protect the images, the best way is to add a watermark or a layer of image. 
If one wish to use the original image (without watermark), then he or she must pay for it. 
This could be taken as permission granted to use the image. 
In our project, one can download the image without any copyright issues. 
Initially images are presented to user with a watermark. 
This watermark defines that the copyright stays with the photographer and our site. 
Images cannot be downloaded without watermark until the user logins. 
Thus, granting user to use the image. 
This project basically manages the information of media. It also provides searching facility based on various factor to a user.
